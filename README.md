- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Tayllernnt
This interface doesn't have any code. You'll need to input some code. This base interface was created to assist you in building
a drawing website. All explanatory content is in Portuguese, but kindly request translation only for the Portuguese sections on
the ChatGPT website. To open the interface, open the 'index.html' file in your browser from the 'main' folder. The code is in 'drawing.js,'
 and the CSS is in 'style.css.' That's it! Hope this helps. Goodbye."
